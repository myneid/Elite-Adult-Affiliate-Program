                    &ldquo;ACCEPT&rdquo; BUTTON ON THE SIGN UP FORM YOU ARE AFFIRMATIVELY STATING THAT

                    AND ARE AFFIRMATIVELY INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AFFILIATE 
                    PROGRAM AGREEMENT AND YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS HEREOF. YOU 
                    CANNOT BECOME A MEMBER OF THE AFFILIATE PROGRAM UNLESS YOU HAVE ACCEPTED 
                    EACH AND EVERY TERM HEREOF.<br>
                    <br>
                    1. Enrollment in this Program. <br>
                    <br>
                    To begin the enrollment process, you will submit a completed Program 
                    Application through our website http://www.ManClicks.com/signup.php. We 
                    will reject your application if we determine that you have provided 
                    inaccurate or incomplete signup information, determine that you are 
                    under 18 years of age (21 in some jurisdictions) or determine that your 
                    site is unsuitable for the Program for any reason, including, but not 
                    limited to, if your site incorporates images or content that is 
                    unlawful, defamatory, obscene, harassing or otherwise objectionable, 
                    such as sites that facilitate illegal activity or promote violence or 
                    promote or assist others in promoting copyright infringement 
                    (collectively, &ldquo;Content Restrictions&rdquo;). Again, you must be at least 
                    eighteen (18) years of age (or older if legal age of majority is more 
                    than 18) to participate in this Program.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. Utilizing Links on Your Site. <br>
                    <br>
                    As an affiliate website of COMPANY (&ldquo;Affiliate Site&rdquo;), you may use any 
                    form of promotion you choose, consistent with the terms of this 
                    Agreement (note: &ldquo;per unique&rdquo; commission program affiliates may only use 
                    banners supplied by COMPANY). You may use banner advertisements, button 
                    links and/or text links to our site (the &ldquo;Links&rdquo;), however, you cannot 
                    employ deceptive language or misleading URL&rsquo;s in the Links, and you 
                    CANNOT MARKET BY SENDING UNSOLICITED BULK E-MAILS!!! (As used herein, 
                    UBE, or &ldquo;Spam&rdquo; refers to the transmission of unsolicited bulk e-mails, 
                    i.e., not derived from a verifiable opt-in program or sent absent a 
                    prior business relationship with the recipient). Any activity by you or 
                    on your behalf that we determine or reasonably suspect to be the result 
                    of an unsolicited bulk e-mail program will result in your immediate 
                    termination from the Program and your forfeiting of monies otherwise due 
                    you hereunder. (For further guidelines on this topic, please see Section 
                    5, below.) Allowable promotional links may contain COMPANY&rsquo;s trade 
                    names, service marks, and/or logos for display on your Affiliate Site. 
                    Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, you are granted a limited, 
                    non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and download such 
                    Links and other designated promotional materials for placement on your 
                    Affiliate Site for the sole and exclusive purpose of promoting websites 
                    owned, operated or controlled by COMPANY. In utilizing the Links, you 
                    agree that you will cooperate fully with us in order to establish and 
                    maintain such Link or Links. A Link may only be visually modified with 
                    our consent.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. Commissions. <br>

                    There is a one month lag for fraud prevention purposes.<br>
                    <br>
                    5. ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY REGARDING BULK E-MAILINGS<br>
                    <br>
                    We do allow Webmasters to market websites promoted through this Program 
                    through the transmission of bulk e-mails, however, it is extremely 
                    important that any such mass e-mailings by you conform to our policies. 
                    Additionally it is required to sign a separate affidavit indicating that 
                    you are in compliance with the Can-Spam Act of 2003. To request the Can 
                    Spam Compliance form please email support@ManClicks.com with your company 
                    details.<br>
                    <br>
                    The marketing of websites promoted by this Program is strictly 
                    prohibited if done through the transmission of unsolicited bulk email. 
                    In other words, you must have a prior business relationship with the 
                    e-mail recipient, including but not limited to having obtained their 
                    e-mail address through a verifiable opt-in procedure. We strongly 
                    encourage you to maintain electronic records of the manner in which you 
                    obtain e-mail addresses for use in mailings. This is because, if we 
                    receive a complaint from a person who received a promotional e-mailing 
                    from you, you will need to demonstrate to us that such person did not 
                    receive unsolicited bulk e-mail from you. <br>
                    <br>
                    We also strictly prohibit you from transmitting e-mail that makes use of 
                    or contains invalid or forged headers, invalid or non-existent domain 
                    names or other means of deceptive addressing (&ldquo;counterfeit e-mail&rdquo;). Do 
                    NOT do this. <br>
                    We also strictly prohibit you from transmitting e-mail that is relayed 
                    from any third party's mail servers without the permission of that third 
                    party, or which employs similar techniques to hide or obscure the source 
                    of the e-mail. Do NOT do this. <br>
                    <br>
                    The transmission of unsolicited bulk e-mail, including the transmission 
                    of counterfeit e-mail, may result in civil and criminal penalties 
                    against the sender under applicable federal and/or state law.<br>
                    <br>
                    We do NOT authorize the harvesting or collection of screen names from 
                    any ISP service (for example, AOL) for the purpose of sending 
                    unsolicited e-mail, and will terminate without pay any webmaster 
                    determined to have transmitted bulk emails advertising any websites 
                    marketed through this Program to lists gathered by such methods. <br>
                    <br>
                    Should we determine, in our sole discretion that you have violated this 
                    AUP, be assured that you will be terminated immediately, will be 
                    ineligible to sign up for another account, will not be paid for any 
                    traffic or subscriptions generated prior to the date of termination; and 
                    your registration information may be turned over to complaining parties 
                    (including AOL). <br>
                    <br>
                    HOW TO REPORT UNSOLICITED BULK E-MAIL<br>
                    If you believe you are the recipient of unsolicited bulk e-mail from a 
                    person or company advertising websites under this Program, please follow 
                    this procedure: <br>
                    <br>
                    Please send your UBE complaint to COMPANY through its Customer Service 
                    Representative. The best and easiest way to do this is by forwarding the 
                    offending e-mail to abuse@ManClicks.com. If you cannot forward the UBE, 
                    simply send an e-mail to abuse@ManClicks.com. In either case, please 
                    include your name, address, telephone number and any information you may 
                    have about the identity of the person or entity that sent the UBE to 
                    you. You may be able to collect information about the sender from the 
                    e-mail itself, for instance, by examining the e-mails &ldquo;header,&rdquo; by 
                    examining the webpage or by running a whois query against the webpage 
                    domain. <br>
                    <br>
                    6. Non-Exclusive Limited License and Use of Affiliate Logos and 
                    Trademarks. <br>
                    <br>
                    You grant us a non-exclusive license to utilize your names, titles and 
                    logos, trademarks (collectively the &ldquo;Affiliate Trademarks), to 
                    advertise, market, promote and publicize in any manner our rights 
                    hereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, we shall not 
                    be required to so advertise, market, promote or publicize. You hereby 
                    represent and warrant that you are the sole and exclusive owner of the 
                    Affiliate Trademarks and have the right and power to grant to us the 
                    license to use same in the manner contemplated herein, and such grant 
                    does not or will not (i) breach, conflict with or constitute a default 
                    under any agreement or other instrument applicable to you or binding 
                    upon you, or (ii) infringe upon any trademark, trade name, service mark, 
                    copyright, or other proprietary right of any other person or entity. 
                    This license shall terminate upon the effective date of the expiration 
                    or termination of this Agreement.<br>
                    <br>
                    7. Responsibility for Your Site. <br>
                    <br>
                    You will be solely responsible for the development, operation and 
                    maintenance of your site and for all materials that appear on your site. 
                    You are not COMPANY&rsquo;s agent, and we shall have no responsibility for the 
                    development, operation and maintenance of your site and for all 
                    materials that appear on your site. You shall also be responsible for

                    the rights of any third party (including, for example, copyrights, 
                    trademarks, privacy, or other personal or proprietary rights), and 
                    ensuring that materials posted on your site are not libelous or 
                    otherwise illegal. You must have express permission to use another 
                    party&rsquo;s copyrighted or other proprietary material. We will not be 
                    responsible if you use another party&rsquo;s copyrighted or other proprietary 
                    material in violation of the law. In addition to the foregoing, we will 
                    immediately terminate your participation in the Program if we believe
